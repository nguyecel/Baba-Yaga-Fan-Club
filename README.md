# Baba-Yaga-Fan-Club
Official Fanpage for the cat, Baba Yaga. Come celebrate and bask in his divine smell.

This is a practice project for my web development learning, and what better focus than my lovely son, Baba Yaga. He makes me very happy even though he doesn't know it, and my days would be darker and lonelier without him. It is partly because of him that I even wanted to learn software development in order to give him a better life. I never thought I'd love a pet so much, but I am grateful every day.

All the love to Baba Yaga!
